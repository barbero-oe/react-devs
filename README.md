# Flexiana React coding task

## The Goal

The goal of this coding challenge is to get familiar with your coding skills, but also to learn the way you like your code to be organized.

Imagine, you receive this request from the Customer. Of course, sometimes the Customer does not know what is possible and what isn’t. Our role is to help him and explain how his requirements can be achieved in the best way possible.

## Customer’s requirements

The Customer would like to receive a simple React app that would enable him to look through users on Github. He doesn’t require any fancy layout, just functionality.

The Customer would like to be able to search for some information about GitHub users. For example, they would like you to explore whether it is possible to search Github for all the users who have contributed to the “facebook/react” repository. Moreover, it would be great to have a possibility to search for all repositories with “*react*” or other text in the title and see all the usernames of their contributors.

## Technology

The task needs to be a React application. For getting the Github data you can use whatever you are more comfortable with:
- GraphQL API: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql 
- or REST API https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest 

## Next steps

At first, communicate what is possible to deliver and what isn’t. Discuss any unclear things in customer’s requirements. After that proceed to implementation and deliver the result in the form of React Native code.

If you have any questions feel free to ask them through email.

Good luck!
